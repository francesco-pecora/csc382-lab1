# CSC 382 - Analysis of Algorithms - Insertion Sort & Merge Sort

For each algorithm, and for each n = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 4000, 10000, measure its running time and number of steps when the input is (1) already sort, i.e. n, n-1, …, 3, 2,1; (2) reversely sorted 1, 2, 3, … n; (3) random permutation of 1, 2, …, n; (4) 50 instances of n random numbers generated in the range of [1..n].

Note:

- You may have to repeat the algorithm many times, each time you need to initialize the array.

- Your running time should exclude the time for initialization. 

- All measurement should be done in a single run, i.e. you do not need to run once for n=100, another time for n=200, etc

 

What to turn in:

- Well documented source code in Python

- Report the number of steps and the CPU running time in a table (Add this result in your previous table).

- Plot the running time of the algorithm results (Add this result in your previous plot).

- Approximation the constant c in the complexity of heap sort (cnlgn) by inspecting the results
